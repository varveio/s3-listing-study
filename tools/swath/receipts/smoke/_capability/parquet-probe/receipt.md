# Smoke receipt — `swath` / mode `parquet-probe`

Produced by `harness/smoke-run.sh`. Not a benchmark: this run makes no
comparative claim and its duration is a fact about this run only.

Serialized from the same argv array that was executed — not reconstructed.
Container is started detached so the wrapper can sample memory and read the
cgroup while the process lives; it is removed by the wrapper afterwards.

> Runner location is recorded because RTT sets the ratio of network
> time to CPU time in a listing run: a runner outside the bucket region
> can mask per-page CPU cost that would be significant in-region. For an
> RTT-bound tool it does **not** bias serial-vs-parallel comparison — to
> first order that ratio is the concurrency factor — but client CPU,
> output back-pressure, and throttling can pull real ratios below it.
> Recorded so a reader can judge; irrelevant at smoke scale, which
> produces no comparative numbers.

### Measured shape (from the registry)

- **Top level**: 4 prefixes + 1 root-level key —
  `normals-monthly/` 48,796 · `normals-daily/` 48,787 ·
  `normals-annualseasonal/` 48,784 · `normals-hourly/` 2,549 · `index.html` 1.
- **Depth histogram** (`/`-count): depth 0 → 1 key, depth 2 → 29,986,
  depth 3 → 118,930. No deep nesting; the tree is broad and shallow.
- **Largest second-level prefixes**: `normals-monthly/1991-2020/` 15,625 ·
  `normals-daily/1991-2020/` 15,624 · `normals-annualseasonal/1991-2020/`
  15,623 · the `2006-2020/` trio ≈ 13,480 each · the `1981-2010/` trio ≈
  9,840 each.
- ≥149 LIST pages un-delimited at the 1,000-key page cap.

## Memory

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peak_rss` | 320.6 MB | `VmHWM` of the container's main process, 72 successful samples. **Main process only** — a multi-process fan-out mode's children are not included. |
| `cgroup_peak_mem` | 302.3 MB | cgroup v2 `memory.peak`, whole container tree, 72 successful samples. **Page cache and kernel/socket memory included. Never present this as RSS.** |

**Both numbers are sampled**, polled every 50 ms. Each is a
kernel-maintained high-water mark, so a poll returns the true peak as of
that read; the unmeasured window is between the last poll and process
exit. The container cgroup is destroyed at exit, so neither can be read
post-mortem. `unavailable` means the value was never successfully read —
it is not zero, and it is not a finding about the tool.

**Neither number bounds the other, and neither is a sanity check on the
other.** `VmHWM` counts pages resident in the main process, including
shared/file-backed pages that may be charged to a **different** cgroup;
`memory.peak` counts memory charged to **this** cgroup and excludes pages
charged elsewhere. `peak_rss` > `cgroup_peak_mem` is normal where the
image is already hot in page cache.

## API call count

swath exposes an S3 API-call counter in its end-of-run `list_run_summary` /
`list_run_diagnostics` log lines (stderr, at `-v`). Observed this run:

- `api_calls` (total ListObjectsV2 issued): **120**
- `api_calls_per_1k_objects`: 7.68
- worker range pages: 28; `peak_in_flight` (max concurrent LISTs): 8
- `probe_fetches` (speculative 1-key pivot + delimiter=/ structure probes): 46; `empty_upper_bisections`: 28
- `steals`=57 `splits`=7 `errors`=0 `throttle_events`=0 `transient_events`=0

peak_in_flight>1 confirms LISTs run in parallel (the WorkStealingScan engine), capped
here at the run's `--max-parallel-listings 8`. Full per-request logging defers to the replay-server phase.

## Raw output

- stdout: inline — `stdout.txt` (0 bytes, sha256 `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`)
- stderr: inline — `stderr.txt` (3302 bytes, sha256 `7a12ea56469864d37aeb9719a9a33d10430e9858dbb86ea562cbb826fd851673`)
- Redaction altered bytes: **no**

Redacted and secret-scanned **before** hashing: the hash freezes the bytes,
so redaction after it would redact nothing. Machine-readable binding for the
verifier is in `run.meta`.
